## Hi there 👋
 💬My name is Ethan and I am a 4th year student studying Computer Science specializing in Web Development. <br />
 
 🌱 I am knowledgable in languages such as C++ and python, but am looking to expand on my knowledge through learning JavaScript, React, C##, through current classes, and projects. <br />

 📝 I am currently working on a year long Capstone project with my University in conjunction with our sponsor company.

⚡Outside of tech I enjoy video games, poker, various sports, and fashion. <br />
