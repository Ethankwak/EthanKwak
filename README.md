## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
 ðŸ’¬My name is Ethan and I am a 4th year student studying Computer Science specializing in Web Development.
 ðŸŒ± I am knowledgable in languages such as C++ and python, but am looking to expand on my knowledge through learning JavaScript, React, C##, through current classes, and projects.

âš¡Outside of tech I enjoy video games, poker, various sports, and fashion.
